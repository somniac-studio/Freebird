an android based client for misskey / mastodon / federated networks

This project is based on the work of Misskey.io and intends to provide the general public access to it's services with ease.
As the aim is to provide access to an open source federated network it would be against the spirit of things to monetize or monopolize entry to such
a service. If development goes well, a tablet, wearOS and iOS variant could see development.

This is a spare time project, so expect infrequent updates, as i'm primarily an artist, not a programmer, I just have a vested interest in an APK for myself.
